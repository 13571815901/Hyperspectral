Deep Learning for Land-cover Classification in Hyperspectral Images
===================================================================

Hyperspectral images are images captured in multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. This project is focussed at the development of Deep Learned Artificial Neural Networks for robust landcover classification in hyperspectral images. Land-cover classification is the task of assigning to every pixel, a class label that represents the type of land-cover present in the location of the pixel. It is an image segmentation/scenelabeling task. The following diagram describes the task.

Convolutional Neural Network
----------------------------

(CNN or ConvNet) are a special category of artificial neural networks designed for processing data with a gridlike structure. The ConvNet architecture is based on sparse interactions and parameter sharing and is highly effective for efficient learning of spatial invariances in images. There are four kinds of layers in a typical ConvNet architecture: convolutional (conv), pooling (pool), fullyconnected (affine) and rectifying linear unit (ReLU). Each convolutional layer transforms one set of feature maps into another set of feature maps by convolution with a set of filters.

Architecture of Convolutional Neural Network used
-------------------------------------------------

**input- [conv - relu - maxpool] x 2 - [affine - relu] x 2 - affine - softmax**

The system was trained on a machine with dual Intel Xeon E5-2630 v2 CPUs, 32 GB RAM and NVIDIA Tesla K-20C GPU.

Description of the toolbox
--------------------------

- `IndianPines_DataSet_Preparation_Without_Augmentation.ipynb` does the following operations:
	
	* Loads the Indian Pines dataset
	* Scales the input between [0,1]
	* Mean normalizes the channels
	* Makes training and test splits
	* Extracts patches of given size
	* Oversamples the training set for balancing the classes

- `IndianPinesTF.ipynb` builds the TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Network and defines the training and evaluation ops:

	* inference() - Builds the model as far as is required for running the network forward to make predictions.
	* loss() - Adds to the inference model the layers required to generate loss.
	* training() - Adds to the loss model the Ops required to generate and apply gradients.
	* evaluation() - Calcuates the classification accuracy 

- `convolutional_feed.ipynb` Trains and evaluates the Neural Network using a feed dictionary

- `Decoder_Spatial.ipynb` Generates the landcover classification of an input hyperspectral image for a given trained network

- `credibility.ipynb` Summarizes the predictions of an ensemble and produces the land-cover classification and class-wise confusion matrix.
